    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p id="about_me">My name is Grace Hinkle, I am 20 and live in boise, Idaho. I am a Junior
      at Boise State University studying Videogame Development and currently work 3 jobs. I would love to table a booth at AnimeID 
      2025 using my artist name Tempestspell!</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Why I am Applying</h3>
    <p id="about_me">I always wanted to sell my own art but was always too scared and confused, but after getting the wonderful 
      opportunity to run a small booth of my own art at the Boise Comic Arts Festival in August of 2024 through BSU, 
      I would love to create art for, apply and run a booth entirely of my own at local conventions. I went to AnimeID last year and 
      really enjoyed it and would love to see it grow in success considering it is the only big anime convention I know of in the area. 
      If given the opportunity I'd love to grow as an artist while also working at something local I want to support.

        <!-- <p>The tables were bought by my majors department 
          at BSU and allowed kids to showcase videogame work in a corner of the Artist Alley. I decided to focus on showcasing both my 
          digital and traditional art for commission work as well as sell prints and stickers of my digital work for the first time. I was 
          extremely nervous and doubted in my skills to prepare properly with no prior experience and on such short notice (we had gotten the notice 2 weeks prior), 
          along with not sell anything given my doubts as an artist, but it went the opposite. It was a small booth with little to sell, but still 
          selling all of my digital prints and getting many commissions gave me the confidence boost I needed, while also teaching me a lot 
          about entering the world of boothing and selling art.</p> -->
